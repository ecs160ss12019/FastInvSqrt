Story Mapping: https://github.com/ecs160ss12019/FastInvSqrt/blob/master/StoryMapping.md
<p>The goal of this project is to create a clone of the Atari 2600 game <em>Super Breakout</em>, possibly with expansions on top of the already existing game. Currently, we are aiming to replicate the original game modes and tentatively adding more features such as powerups and non-monochromatic simplistic graphics.</p>
<p>Currently, we have not split up the workload in regards to each individual member.</p>
