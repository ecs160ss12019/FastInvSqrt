# Story Mapping for Breakout

## BHAG
You are a paddle, and you are attemping to destory as many bricks as possible by using a ball that you bounce, while ensuring that it stays in bound.

## User Goals:
- Paddle: As a paddle, I am attempting to reflect the ball when it hits me.
- Ball: As a ball, I bounce around the screen destroying the blocks.
- Brick: As a brick, I disappear and change the ball's angle by some degree on contact and drop items if I am an item brick.
- Stage Level: As a stage level, I generate the wall placement according to a difficulty.
- Effect-Object: As an effect object I want to generate special effects when the ball comes into contact with me.
- UI/UX interface: As the UI/UX interface I want to display relevant information and game control buttons in an aesthetically pleasing way.

|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint 1   | Able to be move paddle and bounce the ball back	| Moves around the screen and bounces off bricks and screen edges.	| Able to be placed on screen and change the angle of the ball on contact.	| Generate a hardcoded level. |	Create a wormhole object that teleports the ball to a different wormhole.| Add buttons that control the horizontal movement of the paddle. |
| Sprint 2   | Able to change paddle size based on items and achieve finer controls using physics	| Able to adjust speed of ball based on items and duration of the game	|  Power-Up and Power-Down bricks are able to drop items that modify the paddle and ball. Bricks can dissappear when destroyed by ball.	| Able to programatically change level and select levels from the title screen.	|	Create a spike object that destroys the ball and decrements the number of lives left. | Add display that keeps track of number of lives left, current stage level, and score. For now use a simple scoring system. Also add a pause button to pause the game. |
| Sprint 3   | Add sound effect when ball makes contact with paddle. Add animation when paddle changes size.	|  Animation and effects for when the ball makes contact with special objects(spikes and wormholes)	|  Add animation and sound effects for destruction of bricks. Add explosive bricks that destroy surrounding bricks on contact.	| Design original levels.	| Add animations and sound effects for both spikes and wormholes. | Modify scoring system to a combo-based scoring system. Add animation and sound effects for when lives decrement, score increments, and when reaching combos. |

|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint 1   | When the left and right buttons are pressed the paddle should move accordingly. The ball should bounce off the paddle when their hit boxes collide. | The ball should move around the screen and bounce of bricks and screen edges.	| Bricks should be able to be placed on the screen and change the velocity of the ball and dissappear when hit.	| After selecting level and difficulty, I should be able to start playing.| Special objects should be able to be placed on the map.	| The movement of the paddle should be able to be controlled by buttons |
| Sprint 2   | When the paddle gets a size-changing item it should change size. When the paddle is moved, it should have realistic fine-tuned movements	| As the game progresses, the speed of the ball should be adjusted | When Power-Up and Power-Down bricks are hit, they should drop items that modify the paddle and ball.	|  Objects of a stage-level should be generated at proper positions when map data is loaded in. When selecting a level from the title screen, the correct level should load.	|	When the ball hits a wormhole, it should teleport to the connected wormhole. When the ball hits a spike, it should be destroyed and a life should be lost | As the game progesses, a display should update and keep track of the number of lives, current stage level, and score.|
| Sprint 3  | The paddle should have animation and sound effects when changing size	| When the ball makes contact with special objects(spikes and wormholes), there should be animations and sound effects.	|  When bricks are destroyed, there should be animations and sound effects.	| Design original levels.	| When spikes and wormholes are hit, there should be animations and sound effects. | The scoring system should be more complex and combo-based. When lives decrement, score increments, and when combo scores are reached, there should be animation and sound effects. |
